## RSM (Replicated State Machines)

### Overview

[**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org) crate providing basic blocks for building distributed
systems. It features low level primitives built on atomics as well as higher level constructs such
as a [**Raft**](https://raft.github.io/) toolkit.

### Features

 * Fast user-space synchronization primitives built on atomics: lock, read-write lock, gate, once,
   semaphore, events and more!
 * Basic finite state-machine automata, great for building actor systems!
 * Fast [**Raft**](https://raft.github.io/) protocol 100% implemented as an automaton.


Please note this is still a *work in progress*. It is a great educational resource for whoever
wants to learn how things like locks or finite state-machine work. It is not yet published on
https://crates.io/ but will be soon.
